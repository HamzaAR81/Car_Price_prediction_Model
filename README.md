## Project Overview

Used Car price prediction is a common problem in the market place. This project explores building a predictive model using machine learning techniques to estimate the price of a used car. The Jupyter Notebook provides step-by-step guidance on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various cars and their attributes. It includes data such as car name, model year, mileage, Transmission, fuel type and more. The dataset is available in the [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayaadithyanvg/car-price-predictionused-cars) directory.

## Model Building
The machine learning model is built using Python and leverages popular libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and others. The model is trained on the dataset to predict car prices.

## Evaluation
The performance of the car price prediction model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2) score, and others. The evaluation results are detailed in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage
This project is intended for Internship purpose and as a reference for building predictive models.
